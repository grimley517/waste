## Context

Working in a school environment as head of ICT I need a way of searching students home drives quickly and 
efficiently and characterising the extent of waste storage.  The school network is a NT environment.  
currrent work flow requirement is simpley to inform me of what suspicious files there are in students home drives, 
which student, and how big.

Students home drives are to be used for school work purposes.  Therefore no file extension should be completely out there.  More wanting to identify for manual follow up.  Later this could be used to automate the follow up.
Students home drives are visible to me in a read only drive with students folders being the first level directories.
